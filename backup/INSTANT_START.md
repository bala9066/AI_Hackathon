## 🎯 Your Mission: 3 Simple Steps

### STEP 1: Get API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create new key (copy it - starts with `sk-...`)
3. Open `.env` file (double-click it)
4. Paste your key after `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
5. Save and close

### STEP 2: Start Everything
1. Double-click: **`setup_and_start.bat`**
2. Wait 60 seconds
3. Browser opens to http://localhost:5678
4. Login: `admin` / `admin123`

### STEP 3: Import Workflow
1. In n8n: Click "Workflows" → "Import from File"
2. Select: `AI_Hardware_Pipeline_Workflow.json`
3. Click Import
4. Click on any "OpenAI" node → Add your API key as credential
5. Toggle "Activate" to ON
6. Double-click: **`test_simple.bat`**

**Done! 🎉**

40dBm output power, 5-18GHz frequency range, 
GaN power amplifier, buck-boost converters"
```

Or simpler:
```
"Design IoT temperature sensor with ESP32, 
DHT22 sensor, battery powered, WiFi enabled"
```
